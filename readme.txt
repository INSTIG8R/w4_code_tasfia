Training KNN as a multiclass classification model for recommending a carrier using Tabular dataset.

1) Raw data collection from database
2) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3) Resampling using SMOT, duplication, undersampling
4) Model Training
5) Model Tuning
6) Selecting the best performing model
7) Testing for a single sample.
  a) mlScript.py file contains console testing using the KNN model fitted on all samples.
      use play button or "python run mlScript.py"
  b) streamScript.py file contains Streamlit demo testing using the KNN model fitted on resampled data.
      use "streamlit run streamScript.py"
